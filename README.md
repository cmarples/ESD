# LEOD : Library for Ellipsoid cOmputational Determination {#mainpage}

### Overview {#overview}

LEOD is a Python library for compuationally determining the solutions to complex geometric problems involving ellipsoids.
The problems that LEOD is designed to address include:

* Finding shortest distances over the surface of an ellipsoid.
* Determining the distance between the surface of two ellipsoids.
* Calculation of surface areas of ellipsoidal patches.
* Generating uniform random points on the surface of an ellipsoid.
